  <p>
    I am a principal research engineer at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Meta AI</a>. I currently co-lead a research group on multi-agent AI, where we have published work on game theory 
    in multi-agent learning, and developed state-of-the-art agents for Poker, Hanabi, and Diplomacy using a combination of reinforcement learning and search 
    techniques.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I developed <a href='https://www.github.com/facebookresearch/PyTorch-BigGraph'>PyTorch-Big-Graph (PBG)</a>, a  system for large-scale multi-relation graph embeddings used by dozens of teams at Facebook. PBG is released as an open source package and is in active use by other large organizations. 
  </p>

  <p>I am a member of the original <a href='https://pytorch.org/'>PyTorch</a> developer team, and previously a contributor to LuaTorch.</p>

  <p>Recently, I have been collaborating with the Meta AI Protein team and with external collaborators on machine learning for biology applications.</p>

  <p>
    Prior to Meta/FAIR, I was a member of the embedded software team at <a href='https://www.deshawresearch.com/'>D. E. Shaw Research</a>, where I helped to develop and validate algorithms and numerics for the Anton supercomputers, 
    which use custom ASICs specialized for molecular dynamics simulations. 
  </p>

  <p>I graduated from <a href='https://www.mit.edu/'>MIT</a> with a B.S. in Computer Science and Physics and an M. Eng in Computer Science.</p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>
    My research interests include designing modern deep learning algorithms and 3D computer vision techniques for
    impactful problems in structural biology.
    We are in an incredible moment for computational (and experimental!) structural biology.
    The field has been transformed by  the sudden advent of deep learning methods for highly accurate protein structure
    prediction.
    From only ~100k unique structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), it is now possible to obtain a predicted
    structure for all ~100M known protein sequences with calibrated uncertainty.
    This, coupled with the rise of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and related imaging methods for 3D structure
    determination, has opened up new scientific areas and a fundamentally new lens to approach biological questions, ripe for computational methods development.
    Ultimately, my goal is to develop algorithms that can expand and accelerate real world applications in structural
    biology.
    These applications include cutting-edge visualization methods such as single particle cryo-EM and in situ visual
    proteomics.
    It is also my experience that methods development motivated by biological applications will inspire novel algorithms of
    general interest in artificial intelligence research.
</p>

<h2>Joining</h2>

<p>
    If you are interested in working with me and you are currently a graduate student at Princeton, please reach out via
    email.
    I would be happy to discuss interesting research directions in machine learning for structural biology.
</p>

<p>
    If you are considering applying to CS Ph.D. programs this fall, please apply directly to the Princeton Computer
    Science Ph.D. program.
    Feel free to flag your application via email, but note that I may not be able to respond.
</p>

<p>
    I am also accepting applications for exceptional postdoctoral candidates on a rolling basis. There are a number of
    exciting projects and collaborations in my group, and I would also welcome incubating an independently driven research agenda. Please
    send me a cover letter describing your research interests and future career goals, a CV, and three potential
    references.
